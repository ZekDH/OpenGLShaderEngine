# OpenGLShaderEngine
A C++ OpenGL engine that uses a 2D rectangle mesh to cover the screen with a custom fractal brownian motion shader.
ImGUI panel is registered in the top left hand of screen to allow for uniform variable editing with the fractal brownian motion shader.
Engine was originally used to assist in realtime colour picking for desktop background.

# Executing program
Unfortunately due to my windows computer breaking months ago i am unable to recover my visaul studio project for the engine, with libraries linked correctly. This program assumes you have OpenGL and GLFW installed on your pc within the C drive to compile.

The build can still be run on linux with "./tri" within the ShaderEngine folder. I have included a video i had previously recorded underneath to display what the program did upon execution below.
